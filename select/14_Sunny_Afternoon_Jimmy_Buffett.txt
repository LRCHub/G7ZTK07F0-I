The tax man's taken all my dough
And left me in this stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't even sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I got's this sunny afternoon

In the summertime
Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat momma trying to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her ma and pa
Telling tales of parrot heads and parties
And now I'm just sitting here
Sipping on this ice cold beer
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime
Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me two good reasons why I ought to stay
Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime
In the summertime
In the summertime

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat momma trying to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon

In the summertime
Tax man's taken all my dough
Gonna find that passport and out of here I'll go
