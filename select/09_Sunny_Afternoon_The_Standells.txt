The taxman's taken all my dough
And left me in my stately home
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
And I can't sail my yacht
He's taken everything I've got
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama trying to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime

My girlfriend's run off with my car
And gone back to her Ma and Pa
Telling tales of drunkenness and cruelty
Now I'm sitting here
Sipping at my ice cold beer
All I've got's this sunny afternoon

Help me, help me, help me sail away
Well give me two good reasons why I ought to stay
'Cause I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime

Save me, save me, save me from this squeeze
I got a big fat mama trying to break me
And I love to live so pleasantly
Live this life of luxury
Lazing on a sunny afternoon
In the summertime, in the summertime, in the summertime
In the summertime, in the summertime
